#: Which way the geolocation calls down. Both satellite families this reader serves

#: flying in "local-normal pointing" mode, and the NOAA KLM User's Guide defines nadir
#: as "a line through the satellite which is perpendicular to the surface of the Earth
#: ellipsoid". Naming it here also keeps a product's geometry independent of the

#: The order the platform's roll, pitch and yaw are applied in when the geolocation is

#:
#: pyorbital still defaults to the order it shipped with, so that products made with

#: geolocation shows that order is the less accurate one -- worth up to 2.7 km once a

        """Correct corrupted timestamps using a threshold approach.

        The threshold approach is based on the scanline number and the header
        timestamp. It also works if the majority of scanlines has corrupted
        timestamps.

        The header timestamp is used as a guideline to estimate the offset
        between timestamps computed from the scanline number and the actual
        scanline timestamps in the data. If header timestamp and scanline
        timestamps do not match, no correction is applied.

        Once the offset has been estimated, one can calculate the ideal
        timestamps based on the scanline number. Timestamps deviating more than
        a certain threshold from the ideal timestamps are replaced by
        the ideal timestamps.

        Example files having corrupt timestamps:
            - NSS.GHRR.NA.D81193.S2329.E0116.B1061214.WI
            - NSS.GHRR.NL.D01035.S2342.E0135.B0192627.WI

        Args:
            max_diff_from_t0_head (int): Threshold for offset estimation: A
                scanline timestamp matches the header timestamp t0_head if it is
                within the interval

                    [t0_head - max_diff_from_t0_head,
                    t0_head + max_diff_from_t0_head]

                around the header timestamp.
            min_frac_near_t0_head (float): Specifies the minimum fraction of
                scanline timestamps matching the header timestamp required for
                applying the correction.
            max_diff_from_ideal_t (float): Threshold for timestamp correction:
                If a scanline timestamp deviates more than max_diff_from_ideal_t
                from the ideal timestamp, it is regarded as corrupt and will be
                replaced with the ideal timestamp.
